        <p> Sweden’s geography is primarily flat or gently rolling lowlands but there are mountains in its western areas near Norway. Its highest point is Mount. Kebnekaise at 6,926 feet (2,111 m). Sweden has three main rivers that all flow into the Gulf of Bothnia. They are the Ume, Torne, and the Angerman. The largest lake in Western Europe (and the third-largest in Europe), Vanern, is located in the southwestern part of the country. This means that for Sweden, travel outside the Sweden-norway area will have to be by boat or air.</p>

            <p> Sweden's considered an environmental pioneer. not only have they lowered their birthrate, effectively keeping their population under control, but they've also been very high up on the list of most environmentally clean, having exceptionally clean air and water, combined with low emissions, creating an environment that is most definitely environmentally positive. </p>
